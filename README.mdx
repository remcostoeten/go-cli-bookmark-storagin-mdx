# CLI Bookmark Manager ib Go 

Welcome to the **Bookmark Manager**! Below are the interactive features that make organizing your resources simple and fun. I am such an person that has 5+ browsers with accumulating of 200+ tabs open at the end of the day with interesting stuff, mostly designs and components I want to save as inspiration or use. This helps me store them.

To run either via go by using `go run main.go` or via the shell script by typing `./run.sh`. If you get permission error run `chmod +x run.sh` followed by executing it again.
